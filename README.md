# Algorithms

## Purpose
I am refreshing myself on common searching, sorting, and graph algorithms.
Below is the current list of algorithms I am hoping to tackle.

### Searching
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
* Ternary Search
* Jump Search
* Exponential Search

### Sorting
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

### Graph Traversal
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Dijkstra's Algorithm

## End Goal
Ideally I will come away with a job in MAANG, that is the goal here, but if anything, I'll be a lot smarter than what I was before!
